The ultrahigh-purity copper metal and the ultrahigh-purity copper sulfate are continuously recovered and prepared by adopting a synchronous coupling electrolysis method, so that the production cost can be reduced, the process flow is simplified, the production efficiency is improved, the energy consumption is greatly reduced, and the production safety is improved."
