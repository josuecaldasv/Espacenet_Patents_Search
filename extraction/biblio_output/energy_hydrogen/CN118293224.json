The metal sealing ring is used for solving the problem that hydrogen sealing performance is reduced due to microcracks generated by stress concentration, thermal expansion and other factors when an existing metal sealing ring works at high temperature and high pressure, the three sealing rings which are used in an overlapped mode and are detachable are adopted, the elastic protruding ring is introduced to each sealing ring so that certain deformation and buffering effects can be provided, and the sealing performance of hydrogen is improved. The stress concentration and fatigue influence are reduced, the generation probability of microcracks is reduced, the better sealing effect is achieved, and the service life of the sealing ring is prolonged."
