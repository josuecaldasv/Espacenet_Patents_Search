Many bridges constitute a power plant, power transmission stations are erected at both shores of the water channels, and the electric energy which meets human needs and is low in price can be produced. Energy conversion is realized, water energy is converted into electric energy with low price, the electric energy with low price is converted into hydrogen energy (hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water), and the electric energy with low price and the hydrogen energy are utilized for replacing fossils, such as coal and petroleum, to produce heat energy and kinetic energy. Because the fossils, such as coal and petroleum, are not adopted to produce heat energy and kinetic energy, serious disastrous consequences harmful for human beings, caused by atmospheric pollution, environmental pollution and greenhouse effect, are thoroughly solved, the problem of energy crisis is thoroughly solved, and meanwhile, the fossils, such as coal and petroleum, are saved and preserved. The existing dam power generation, thermal power generation, nuclear power generation and solar power generation required for electric energy are replaced, so that disastrous consequences and adverse factors harmful for human beings are solved, and high price and defects of the existing electric energy are overcome."
