After a large amount of water is gasified, huge pressure difference is generated in the reactor, an ultra-high-temperature hot body generated by the reaction is quickly discharged out of the reactor, and the system is provided with an ultra-high-temperature-resistant pyrolysis chamber which is arranged at an outlet of the reactor and is sufficient to receive any volume of overheated gas, which is a key guarantee for the safety of the reactor. The superheated gas enters the superhigh-temperature-resistant pyrolysis chamber with the chamber wall bestrewed with spray nozzles for spraying water, a sufficient water source spraying environment exists in the chamber, the superheated gas can promote water to be cracked to form hydrogen, oxygen and the like after being in contact with the water, and then the superheated gas enters the separation chamber, so that the main process of producing energy hydrogen by utilizing fusion energy is completed."
