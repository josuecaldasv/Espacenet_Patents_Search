                "p": "The invention discloses a method for generating electricity by coupling and complementing solar energy-biomass energy-hydrogen energy, comprising the following steps: first biomasses are added into a gasifier, and generated biomass syngas enters a generator to generate electric energy after being processed; under the condition of sunniness, the biomass syngas is completely processed and added with hydrogen to be synthesized into methanol gas and water in a methanol synthesis tower, the synthesized methanol is heated in a solar heater and then decomposed into a gas mixture of H2 and CO in a methanol thermal decomposer, and the gas mixture enters the generator to generate the electric energy. The method adopts the biomass energy as a complement of the hydrogen energy and the solar energy during thermal electricity generation and can give full play to the potential of the generator; the biomass energy is used for independently generating electricity without sun, and with sun, the solar energy and the hydrogen energy are used for assisting the biomass energy to generate electricity, thus not only avoiding the sulfide which can not be completely removed from the single biomass energy from corroding gas generators, but also ensuring the stability of network electric power, greatly reducing the electricity generation cost, fully showing the advantage of complementation of the three kinds of energy and realizing round-the-clock operation of the generator."
