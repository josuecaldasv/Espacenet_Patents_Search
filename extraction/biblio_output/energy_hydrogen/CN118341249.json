The method comprises the following steps: carrying out photocatalytic treatment on the waste gas, and then spraying and absorbing the waste gas through a solution, wherein the waste gas contains sulfur-containing organic matters, and the C-S bond energy of the sulfur-containing organic matters is less than 577 kJ/mol. According to the waste gas treatment method of the leaching process in the positive electrode material recovery process, the waste gas is subjected to the photocatalytic reaction firstly, and hydrogen sulfide and organic sulfur insoluble in water can be effectively treated. Therefore, the waste gas treatment method fully utilizes photocatalysis to degrade organic components, and compared with high-temperature combustion, the waste gas treatment method has the advantages of energy conservation and high efficiency. Compared with the traditional method for treating the waste gas only by solution spraying, the method has the advantages that the use amount of the absorption liquid in solution spraying is obviously reduced, and the cost is reduced. And the organic waste gas is more thoroughly purified."
