                "p": "The invention relates to a rice transplanter taking a new-energy hydrogen fuel cell as a power device and belongs to the technical field of the application of new energy. On a bottom plate of a hydrogen fuel cell-based rice transplanter, hydrogen fuel output from a hydrogen fuel container is fed into the hydrogen fuel cell by a hydrogen fuel conveying pipe, generates water through an electrochemical reaction in the hydrogen fuel cell and releases electrical energy; a current is transmitted into a motor by electric leads to convert the electrical energy into mechanical energy; and a computer control device controls a mechanical driving device to drive paddy wheels and rice transplanting pawls to rotate according to a control program and transplant rice seedlings in paddy fields by using the mechanical energy. A rice transplanter driver performs auxiliary regulation and control on the operation of the rice transplanter through a manual control device and a foot control device so as to fulfill the aim of high-quality low-cost and zero-discharge operation of the rice transplanter."
