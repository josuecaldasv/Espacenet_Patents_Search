A sintering feeding airtight mechanism, a degumming furnace section, a sintering furnace section, a water cooling section and a sintering discharging airtight mechanism which allow a bearing box to pass through are sequentially arranged at the rear end of a sintering feeding transverse pushing section in an airtight mode. The sintering feeding airtight mechanism is used for carrying out airtight feeding on the material degreased by the degreasing continuous furnace in the bearing box; the degumming furnace section is used for performing high-temperature degumming on the conveyed materials in the bearing box, and collecting wax oil formed by water cooling after degumming of the materials in the bearing box through a wax collecting device arranged at the side part of the degumming furnace section; the sintering furnace section is used for conducting high-temperature sintering on the conveyed materials in the bearing box. Negative pressure pumping is carried out through the vacuum pump set, argon is filled inside, hydrogen is not introduced like the prior art any more, and the continuous furnace has the advantages of being small in energy consumption loss and large in product yield on the basis of the same amount; and the efficiency is greatly improved, and the productivity is increased."
