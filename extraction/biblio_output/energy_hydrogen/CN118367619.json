The system comprises a new energy power generation device, an oxygen-enriched coal power unit, a methanol preparation device and the like. The method comprises the following steps: in the oxygen-enriched coal power unit, coal reacts with oxygen, flue gas with relatively high carbon dioxide concentration is obtained after the reaction, and carbon dioxide in the flue gas is captured and stored. The electric energy generated by the new energy power generation is used for providing energy supply for the electrolyzed water. Oxygen prepared by electrolyzing water can provide oxygen supply for oxygen-enriched combustion, hydrogen prepared by electrolyzing water can synthesize methanol with the captured and stored carbon dioxide, and the prepared methanol is stored. The oxygen-enriched coal power unit operates at full load, and all the generated electric energy is sent to a power grid. New energy power generation completely comes from wind power and photovoltaic power generation, and electric energy generated by the new energy power generation is completely used for electrolyzing water. The oxygen-enriched coal power unit in the coupling system does not need to operate for a long time in a low-load mode, and the operation efficiency, the economical efficiency and the service life of the unit are guaranteed."
