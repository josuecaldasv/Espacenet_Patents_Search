An electrode terminal is led out to serve as a cathode; the first electrode layers of the membrane electrodes are connected in parallel through conductive materials and are led out through electrode terminals to serve as anodes; a hollow inner cavity is exposed out of the two end faces of the electric pile, the end cover comprises a first through hole, and the first through hole and the hollow inner cavity are communicated to form a hydrogen channel; the side face of the shell comprises a second through hole, and the second through hole is communicated with the outer side of the second electrode layer of the electric pile to form an oxygen and generated water channel. According to the scheme, the multilayer coaxial hollow fiber composite membrane electrode is adopted, so that the membrane area of effective catalytic oxidation-reduction reaction of the fuel cell in unit volume can be greatly increased, and the energy density and the power density of the fuel cell are improved."
