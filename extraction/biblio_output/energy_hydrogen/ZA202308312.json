The present invention constructs all feasible vertical stacking models by taking different semiconductors as substrates; analyzes electronic properties and energy band structures of different semiconductor heterojunctions based on a first principle calculation method; selects a semiconductor heterojunction configuration with low binding energy for stability analysis according to a calculation result, and screens to obtain a type-II heterojunction that can be used as a photocatalyst; calculates electrical and optical characteristics of a semiconductor heterojunction that can be used for photocatalytic water splitting under different pH values to obtain an optimal heterojunction photocatalyst; and calculates and analyzes the influence of an applied external stress and an introduced structural defect on the photocatalytic related performance of the heterojunction, thereby obtaining a method for optimizing and regulating performance of the heterojunction. The present invention may be used to guide the construction of the two-dimensional semiconductor heterojunction in photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production and the optimization and regulation of performance of the constructed heterojunction."
