In the working process of the battery, circulating water of the metal bipolar plate permeates into a gas flow channel on the other side through pores through coordinated control over the flow speed and pressure of circulating water and gas, dry gas is humidified and permeates and wets a membrane electrode under the action of concentration gradient, and meanwhile, generated liquid water permeates into the membrane electrode through the action of pressure gradient and capillary action. And the water permeates to the circulating water side from the diffusion layer of the membrane electrode and the micropores of the metal bipolar plate and is discharged along with the circulating water, so that the water content of the membrane electrode is dynamically regulated in two directions, the dual functions of humidifying and water discharging are realized, the stability of the cell is improved, the electrochemical corrosion of the metal bipolar plate is reduced, and an auxiliary system of the fuel cell is simplified."
