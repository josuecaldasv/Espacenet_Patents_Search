The method comprises the following steps: taking a water vapor reforming channel as a reaction area for hydrogen production by water vapor reforming in a micro-reactor, and enabling mixed gas of inflowing methanol and water to be subjected to reforming reaction under the condition that the mixed gas passes through a catalyst to be implanted, so as to generate hydrogen; compared with a traditional mode that hydrogen is directly supplied through a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank, operation is more convenient and flexible; the electric heating piece is used for electrically heating the water vapor reforming channel, the electric heating piece can rapidly heat after giving voltage, the temperature rapidly rises in a short time, compared with a traditional methanol air catalytic combustion reaction for heat production, the electric heating piece is faster in temperature rise and higher in methanol utilization rate, and the starting speed of the micro reactor is increased."
