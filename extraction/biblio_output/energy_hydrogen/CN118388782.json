According to the preparation method provided by the embodiment of the invention, a ZIF-67 metal organic framework is prepared from a cobalt salt alcoholic solution and a dimethylimidazole alcoholic solution, histidine is taken as a chiral source, and the chiral ZIF catalyst is prepared through ligand exchange at room temperature. On one hand, the introduction of a chiral ligand His can cause the chirality to be amplified from the ligand to a metal active site, so that the spin state of the active site is changed, the spin state change is mainly caused by the introduction of the chiral ligand, and the change of the spin state can influence the adsorption and desorption of an oxygen-containing intermediate in the OER process; therefore, the reaction energy barrier in the OER process is optimized, and the overpotential is reduced; and on the other hand, due to the introduction of chirality, a spin polarization current is generated in the electrocatalytic water splitting process, so that the intermediate is influenced by spin reforming, and the overpotential required by the spin overturning process is reduced, namely the potential required by complete water splitting is reduced, so that the hydrogen with the same content can be separated out by using the minimum energy."
