The system comprises an SOFC; the anode gas inlet end of the SOFC is communicated with the gasification furnace; the cathode air inlet end of the SOFC is communicated with a second air compressor; a cathode gas outlet end of the SOFC is communicated with a permeation side inlet of the WGSMR, and an anode gas outlet end of the SOFC is communicated with a supply side inlet of the WGSMR; a permeation side outlet of the WGSMR is sequentially communicated with a gas turbine, a third boiler and a fourth boiler; a supply side outlet of the WGSMR is sequentially communicated with the rear combustion chamber, the Rankine cycle device, the first boiler, the second boiler and the carbon dioxide trapping device; a steam generation device of the refrigeration unit comprises a first boiler and a third boiler; a steam generation device of the fresh water production unit comprises a second boiler and a fourth boiler. The SOFC, the WGSMR and the combustion chamber are connected to cooperatively process anode tail gas and cathode tail gas of the SOFC to obtain hydrogen-poor gas, the hydrogen-poor gas is combusted to generate a high-temperature combustion product containing a large amount of carbon dioxide, and water vapor in the high-temperature combustion product is condensed and removed in the heat recovery process to form high-concentration carbon dioxide."
