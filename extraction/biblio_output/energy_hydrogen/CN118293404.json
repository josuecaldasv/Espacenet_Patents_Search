The method specifically comprises the following steps: putting a solid catalyst R into a catalyst reaction device, and inputting reaction gas mixed with H2 and H2S in a gas tank into the catalyst reaction device through a compressor; the catalyst reaction device is closed and heated, when the temperature of the heating device is increased to 310 DEG C or above and the total input energy is 4900 KJ or above, the reaction device is opened, gas and energy in the device flow into a steam generator containing water for a reaction, obtained products comprise steam heat energy and gas, the steam heat energy is collected and used for power generation and recovery, and water is obtained. And the collected gas is condensed by a cooler to obtain H2 and H2S gas for circular reaction. According to the scheme, reaction heat generated by converting molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen can be fully utilized, and the reaction heat is converted into steam heat energy so as to be utilized. The whole scheme is simple and efficient, the power consumption for producing 1.0 ton of steam is only 9.8 kilowatt-hour, and obvious energy-saving and emission-reducing effects are achieved."
