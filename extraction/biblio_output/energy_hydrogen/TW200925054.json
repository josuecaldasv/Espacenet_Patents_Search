                "p": "The present invention is a lifeboat having hydrogen-producing equipment by solar energy, especially referring to a lifeboat which is equipped with a solar energy hydrogen-producing equipment and contains a solar panel, a solar battery, a positive plate, a negative plate, a separation membrane, a hydrogen collection tube, a hydrogen storage alloy bottle, an oxyride battery, a fuel cell storage battery, and a lifeboat so as to achieve the effect of producing hydrogen to supply power. The main features of the invention are that the hydrogen-producing machine installed on the lifeboat is equipped with solar panel and solar battery for storing electricity, and with alkaline solution as an electrolyte, asbestos as a separation membrane, bipolar plates placing on two sides of separation membrane, iron plate as cathode, nickel plate as anode. Overpotential is provided as electricity power for anode and cathode to dissociate water and produce hydrogen. Hydrogen gas is fed through anode and oxygen (or air) is fed through cathode into fuel cell. Alkaline solution is acted as an electrolyte and a permeable thin film is acted as media to produce catalysis action. The electricity power generated from the catalysis action is stored to supply electric appliances on the lifeboat. Hydrogen is a colorless, tasteless, odorless, and non-toxic flammable gas. If hydrogen is fully exploited it can improve the environment, reduce pollution, and enhance the efficiency of electricity generation on a lifeboat. Hydrogen is inexhaustible in nature and the importance and imminence of hydrogen energy is reflected in the present invention."
