After the battery pack is started, if the battery pack is in an abnormal operation state, an adjusting program is triggered, the operation states of the second battery and the first battery are detected in sequence, then influence factors of the abnormal operation are determined, and then the adjusting valve or the flow guide part is adjusted in a targeted mode so as to recover normal operation of the battery pack."
