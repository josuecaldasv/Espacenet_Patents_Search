The battery has a spherical structure, so that external stress can be effectively resisted, and the application range of the battery is widened. The cell electrolyte is a proton conductor type, water is generated at the cathode, and the utilization rate of fuel can reach 100% theoretically. The cathode is arranged on the outermost layer of the spherical structure, so that efficient water supply and drainage are facilitated, and cathode electrochemical reaction is facilitated. According to the battery, a cathode chamber is omitted, so that the battery structure is simpler, and the manufacturing cost is reduced. Meanwhile, as the anode chamber is positioned in the center of the ball, the fuel has a relatively large flexible and adjustable pressure range, the preparation of hydrogen with high purity and wide pressure range is facilitated, the concentration polarization can be obviously reduced, and the utilization rate of the fuel and the energy conversion efficiency of the cell are improved."
