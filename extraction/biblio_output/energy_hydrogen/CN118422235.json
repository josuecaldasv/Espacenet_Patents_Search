According to the system, the PEM electrolytic hydrogen production system can be reasonably configured so as to recover heat energy, and better starting performance and higher energy utilization efficiency can be achieved. The invention further provides a control method of the system, and the influence of the temperature on the hydrogen production efficiency when the PEM electrolytic hydrogen production system is started again can be effectively reduced."
