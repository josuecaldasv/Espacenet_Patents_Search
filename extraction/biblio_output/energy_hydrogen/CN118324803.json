The eutectic compound is of a three-dimensional close packing structure formed by intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction and belongs to a monoclinic system, and the crystal space group is C2/c; a 3, 5-dicarboxyl phenyl phosphate compound is obtained through a simple synthesis method, then the 3, 5-dicarboxyl phenyl phosphate compound and 1, 3, 5-tri (4-pyridyl) benzene are dissolved and recrystallized to obtain the eutectic compound, the crystal structure of the eutectic compound has a continuous conjugation effect, electron delocalization is easily generated, molecular vibration is reduced through a rigid structure, and the eutectic compound has good stability. According to the eutectic compound, the electron mobility in molecules is good, and molecular energy in an excited state is not easy to release in a non-radiation energy form, so that the eutectic compound has good fluorescence emission, can be effectively quenched by nitrobenzene, and has great potential in the field of detecting the content of nitroaromatic pesticide intermediates or explosives."
