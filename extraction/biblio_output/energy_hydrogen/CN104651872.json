                "p": "A solar energy hydrogen producing apparatus is disclosed in the invention and includes: a shell composed of a shell frame and tempered glass installed thereon. The interior of the shell is divided into four layers comprising, from top to bottom, a gas collection chamber, a metal oxide, a water tank chamber and a hollow chamber. An oxygen concentration detection apparatus and a hydrogen concentration detection apparatus are arranged in the gas collection chamber. The gas collection chamber is provided with a gas guide pipe on which a first electromagnetic valve is disposed. A water filling pipe is arranged on the water tank chamber and is provided with a second electromagnetic valve. A controller is disposed in the hollow chamber. The two electromagnetic valves are both connected to an output terminal of the controller. An input terminal of the controller is connected to the oxygen concentration detection apparatus and the hydrogen concentration detection apparatus. The solar energy hydrogen producing apparatus is simple in structure, is reasonable in design, is convenient to achieve and is low in cost. A hydrogen producing process is pollution-free, is free of consumption of reactants and can save resources."
