Comprising a nano aluminum fuel core, a reaction shell assembly, an exhaust one-way valve, a safety valve, a pressure sensor, a temperature sensor, a discharge control valve, a water inlet control valve, a water return control valve, a blow-down valve, a water tank, a preheater, a high-pressure water pump, a heat regenerator, a heat exchanger, a separator and a controller. The nano-aluminum fuel core is processed by using waste aluminum as a raw material, a high-temperature and high-pressure reaction environment is created by violent reaction of nano-aluminum and water, aluminum atoms and water continuously generate hydrogen production reaction and heat release, nano-aluminum is continuously converted into aluminum hydroxide, and the aluminum hydroxide loses crystal water under the condition of being heated, generates dehydration reaction and is decomposed, so that the aluminum hydroxide is subjected to hydrogen production and heat release. And finally converting into aluminum oxide. The heat of the hydrogen production reaction is recycled for heat supply, industrial production process or conversion into electric energy, and green hydrogen can be directly applied to natural gas power plants and hydrogen refueling stations."
