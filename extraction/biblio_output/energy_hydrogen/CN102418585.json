                "p": "The invention relates to a cooling system for safe running of an engine. Most of the cooling systems for automobile engines absorb heat by using water and then dissipate heat through radiators and fans. The invention provides the cooling system based on the innovative design ideas of a system structure and innovative control concepts, namely a special assembly is designed and comprises a refrigeration module, a cooling chamber and a heat dissipation wall. The cooling system can refrigerate water to absorb heat and heats water to preheat the engine, and a water pump and the engine form a circulation loop for running. An electromagnetic valve is controlled by a singlechip, and different cooling loops can be automatically selected in different working conditions of the engine according to temperature of a high-temperature area and cooling water temperature of an outlet of the engine, so the engine can run safely and optimally in the total load working conditions or partial load working conditions. Specially, when a cold engine is started and the engine is started in cold environment, the engine can be preheated quickly, so the friction loss of the engine is reduced or avoided, service life is prolonged, energy sources are saved and emission is reduced. The cooling system can be used for new energy resources, such as solar energy, hydrogen energy, lithium batteries and the like."
