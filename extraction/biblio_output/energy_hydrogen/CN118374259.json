According to the present invention, the self-repairing can be achieved by rearranging the disulfide bond at the crack, such that the self-repairing ability is provided, the self-repairing can be automatically recovered in the static state after the damage, the good performance is maintained, the durability and the reliability of the material are improved, and the safety performance of the new energy battery is substantially improved."
