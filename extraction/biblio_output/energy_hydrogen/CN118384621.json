By arranging the quick assembling mechanism, quick positioning and splicing of the first splicing ring and the second splicing ring can be achieved by means of the characteristic that a connecting sleeve is in sliding connection with a positioning inserting hole, and by means of the characteristic that a threaded sliding groove in the positioning inserting hole is in sliding connection with a fixing protrusion, the quick splicing of the first splicing ring and the second splicing ring is achieved. And primary limiting of the connecting sleeve, the first splicing ring and the second splicing ring can be achieved."
