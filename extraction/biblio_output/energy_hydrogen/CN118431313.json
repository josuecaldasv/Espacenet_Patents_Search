The method has the beneficial effects that secondary alkali etching is adopted, and low-temperature alkali liquor is adopted during the secondary alkali etching, so that the tower footing of the pyramid is larger, the corrosion of the spire position is increased, and the smoother spire is obtained, so that the contact area is enlarged, and the deposition of the polycrystalline silicon thin film is facilitated."
