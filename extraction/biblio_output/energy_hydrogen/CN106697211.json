The support system for the maritime navigation is taken from the sea and used for transportation, aiming to achieve zero pollution of the maritime navigation. The support system for the maritime navigation is constructed by reasonably setting up navigation support stations which obtain energy, hydrogen, electricity and petroleum from the sea so that electric and hydrogen-powered means of transport can replace traditional means of transport which cause serious pollution. The navigation support stations which are located at intersections of routes provide equipment for the transfer of goods and personnel so that vessels do not have to enter harbors, and maritime routes and air routes can be closely in coordination. Some of the navigation support stations comprise fresh water and vegetable self-production supply systems, watercrafts or/and seaplanes for providing mobile supplies and services, marine trash collection and recovery devices for cleaning up the nearby seas, devices for on-site resource utilization for recycled waste plastics and other materials and marine observation and monitoring systems which facilitate to form large marine data. Some of the navigation support stations can also be used to construct a network for BeiDou Navigation Satellite System ground terminal, and measures are taken for toll-modules thereof to cause the hydrogen or electricity to replace fuel."
