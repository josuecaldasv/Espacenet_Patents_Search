When the hydrogen production furnace needs to be rotated, the motor is started, the hydrogen production furnace is controlled to rotate integrally, the first guide roller and the second guide roller at the two ends of the hydrogen production furnace slide and guide along the surfaces of the four carrier rollers respectively until the gas inlet is turned over to one side from the bottom end and is kept parallel to the platform by an angle, and then a worker can maintain and replace the gas inlet on one side; the length of the heating pipe is greater than the height of the furnace chamber, and the heating pipe mounting port is higher than the liquid level of the liquid metal, so that the air inlet can be maintained and replaced in the liquid state, the maintenance is more convenient, and the liquid metal is not solidified, so that the energy consumption during maintenance and overhaul can be greatly reduced."
