The method comprises the following steps: uniformly mixing bituminous coal powder and corncob powder to obtain a mixture A, adding a hydrogen peroxide solution into the mixture A, grinding and uniformly mixing to obtain a mixture B; carrying out vacuum roasting on the mixture B at the temperature of 800-1200 DEG C for 30-90 minutes, and carrying out furnace cooling to obtain a roasted mixture C; deionized water, bacterial liquid and sodium silicate are added into the roasting mixture C, microbial leaching is carried out for 5-10 h at the temperature of 25-65 DEG C, standing layering is carried out, and supernate is removed; and repeating the microbiological leaching step until the supernate is neutral, carrying out solid-liquid separation, and drying the solid to obtain the low-sulfur composite reducing agent. The desulfurization rate of the obtained low-sulfur composite reducing agent reaches 91.2-93.7%, the caking index is 28-53, the reaction activation energy is 13.4-17.7 KJ/mol, and the requirements of the composite reducing agent for industrial silicon are met."
