                "p": "The present invention discloses an AC/DC hybrid electric generator system, comprising: multiple DC generators and multiple AC generators, which are power coupled to each other in series and/or in parallel through multiple shafts and/or multiple transmission mechanisms, and are controlled to operate so as to efficiently generate electricity that is stored in an electricity storage device. Particularly, it is allowed to constitute the AC/DC hybrid electric generator system, a heat pump equipment and a hydrogen production device to be a hybrid energy system. The hybrid energy system can be applied in a container yard, a base station, a container house, a residential house, an office building or a basement."
