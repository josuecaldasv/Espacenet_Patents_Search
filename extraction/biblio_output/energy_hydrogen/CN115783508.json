A plurality of circular grooves are formed in the first limiting plate, and the positions of the supporting assembly and the placing plates are adjusted through the adjusting assembly, so that hydrogen cylinders are limited through the two symmetrically-inclined placing plates; the first limiting plate and the second limiting plate are moved through the moving assembly, the two ends of the hydrogen cylinder are limited, and the structure of the gas inlet end of the hydrogen cylinder is located in the circular groove; and after the first limiting plate and the second limiting plate move and are limited, the width of the whole fixing device is close to the distance between the first limiting plate and the second limiting plate, so that the overall size of the fixing device is reduced, and the device is more convenient to move or convey."
