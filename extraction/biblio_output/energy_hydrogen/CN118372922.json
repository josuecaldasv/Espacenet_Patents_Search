The sleeve is arranged in the secondary insulation module to be matched with the connecting rod, so that the lateral force resistance of the structure is enhanced, the risk that the structure is collapsed is reduced, and the problems of deformation and breakage caused by local structure stress concentration are solved; and meanwhile, when the secondary insulation module is subjected to cold contraction in a low-temperature environment, the connecting rod can axially move relative to the sleeve, so that the cold contraction deformation of the secondary insulation module is compensated."
