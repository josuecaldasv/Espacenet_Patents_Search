According to the portable, safe and adjustable water injection type hydrogen production tank provided by the invention, after water is injected, an adjusting switch can be turned on to prepare hydrogen. The portable, safe and adjustable water injection type hydrogen production tank comprises a vinyl chloride tank body, the tank body is a barrel with an open upper end and a closed lower end, an upper cover used for closing the upper opening end is arranged at the upper opening end of the tank body, and the lower end of the tank body is provided with a lower cover used for closing the lower opening end of the tank body. A barrel-shaped conductive metal nickel lining with an open upper end and a closed lower end is arranged in the tank body, and a through hole is formed in the circle center of the lower closed end of the barrel-shaped lining. The device is convenient to operate, and controllable preparation of hydrogen can be realized only by additionally filling water into the safe and adjustable water injection type hydrogen production tank. An external electric field and heating are not needed in the hydrogen preparation process."
