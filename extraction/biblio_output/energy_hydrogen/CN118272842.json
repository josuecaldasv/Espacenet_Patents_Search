In addition, open-loop feed-forward control and classic PID closed-loop feedback control are introduced, compared with independent traditional PID and independent fuzzy PID control, the introduced feed-forward control is equivalent to compensation for system delay and is not affected by the frequency of an action actuator, and the response speed of the system is increased. And the feedback control is more accurate, so that the system control is accurate, and the system delay can be reduced. Based on the invention, the structures of the high-voltage electrolytic cell and the high-voltage container are designed, so that the hydrogen fuel cell is not affected by the withstand voltage limit value of the electrolytic cell in the water electrolysis reaction of hydrogen production by water electrolysis."
