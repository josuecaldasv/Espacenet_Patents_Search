A large amount of superhigh-temperature heat bodies which are instantaneously produced need to be timely sent to a corresponding pyrolysis chamber outside the reactor to be cracked and then enter a separation tower to produce hydrogen. And directly extracting gas from the temperature region of 4500-2500 DEG C of the inner reactor, and cooling to obtain hydrogen and oxygen. The inner pile facilities are all coated by graphite material inner-cooling sponge bodies, high-pressure water columns are sprayed out or a self-cooling system is used for cooling, the outer pile supplies inner pile pressure and water sources, and the difference between the inner pile facilities and the research of long-term heat group preservation in the traditional technical field is that the device aims to extinguish heat groups as soon as possible and convert nuclear energy into hydrogen energy."
