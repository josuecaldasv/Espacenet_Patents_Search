For delayed coke with the sulfur content of 3-15 wt.%, the silicon dioxide content of 0.5-1.5 wt.%, a small amount of metal impurities such as vanadium and nickel and the fixed carbon content of 80% or above, petroleum coke particles and an alkaline additive are evenly mixed to obtain a mixed material; the mixed material is placed in a microwave roasting furnace, hydrogen-argon mixed gas is introduced at a constant speed, microwave roasting is conducted for 60-90 min at the temperature of 600-1200 DEG C, and a roasted product is obtained; adding the roasted product into deionized water, and performing water immersion treatment under a stirring condition to obtain an intermediate petroleum coke product; and adding the intermediate petroleum coke product into an acid solution for ultrasonic enhanced leaching, and then adding into deionized water for water leaching treatment to obtain a high-purity petroleum coke product. According to the method, the delayed coke can be purified to obtain the high-purity petroleum coke of which the sulfur content is as low as 0.1%, the silicon dioxide content is lower than 0.1%, the volatile component content is lower than 0.1% and the fixed carbon content is more than 99.9%."
