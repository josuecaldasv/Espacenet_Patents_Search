In order to solve the problems that the quality and the yield of a fluorine-containing modified organic silicon material prepared by the existing method are low, and the defoaming performance, the foam inhibition performance and the like need to be improved when the fluorine-containing modified organic silicon material is used as a flatting agent, the fluorine-containing organic silicon polymer is prepared by reacting hydrogen-containing silicone oil and a fluorine-containing monomer with a carbon-carbon double bond in the presence of a noble metal catalyst; the reaction is carried out in a tubular continuous flow reactor. The fluorine-containing organosilicon polymer product obtained by combining the structural design of the fluorine-containing organosilicon polymer with the continuous flow reaction and optimizing the reaction conditions has significantly improved quality and yield, has excellent leveling and defoaming functions when used as a leveling agent, greatly shortens the reaction time, does not need to add a solvent into the reaction raw materials, and is environmentally friendly. According to the invention, the environment pollution is reduced, the harm to the body of an operator is reduced, the raw material cost is reduced through continuous production, and the stability between production batches is realized."
