The resin filter is provided between the circulation pump and the PEM electrolysis tank and is directly connected to the circulation pump and the PEM electrolysis tank, and the gas magnetizer is provided between the PEM electrolysis tank and the low-frequency resonator and is directly connected to the PEM electrolysis tank and the low-frequency resonator. The efficiency-enhancing method of this invention includes an ignition synchronization control step, an electrolysis gas production step, a gas magnetization step, a gas vibration step and a gas introduction step. This invention produces hydrogen gas by electrolyzing deionized water in a PEM electrolysis tank, and introduces the hydrogen gas into the engine to improve the combustion efficiency of fossil fuels, which can solve the problems of poor hydrogen gas production efficiency and insufficient purity of hydrogen gas produced by existing technologies, and provide an engine energy-saving and efficiency-enhancing operation system and an efficiency-enhancing method that can reduce carbon deposits, save fuel and reduce exhaust gas."
