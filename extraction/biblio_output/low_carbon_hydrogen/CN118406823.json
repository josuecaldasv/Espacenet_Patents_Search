According to the method, the clean molten steel is produced through the vacuum direct reduction reaction of the iron ore, the single element S in the steel is controlled to be 5-30 ppm, the P in the steel is controlled to be 10-60 ppm, and the total oxygen in the steel is controlled to be 5-30 ppm. Compared with a traditional process, the process is short, the content of FeO in final slag is low, the molten steel yield is high, the cost of each ton of molten steel is reduced, carbon emission is effectively reduced, and a good solution is provided for major changes of steel smelting and environmental protection."
