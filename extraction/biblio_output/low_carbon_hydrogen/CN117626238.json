The method comprises the following steps of: plating an extremely thin copper film on stainless steel by utilizing a chemical film plating method, and growing the carbon nano tube on the surface of the stainless steel in a tubular furnace under the protection of argon and hydrogen at the temperature of between 500 and 750 DEG C by taking ethanol steam as a carbon source. The copper film which is uniformly distributed is prepared on the surface of the stainless steel through a simple method to serve as a catalyst, growth of the carbon nanotubes can be effectively catalyzed, the method has the advantages of being simple in process, low in treatment cost, short in time and the like, and the purpose of growing a large number of the carbon nanotubes on the surface of the stainless steel can be achieved; the prepared stainless steel can be used as an electrode material of a water system supercapacitor, and has very excellent performance and huge application prospects."
