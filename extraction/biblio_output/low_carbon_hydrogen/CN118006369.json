The invention discloses a biomass hydrogen production double fluidized bed device which comprises an integrated hydrogen production gasification furnace, two bases are symmetrically and fixedly arranged at the lower end of the integrated hydrogen production gasification furnace, supporting plates are fixedly connected to the lower ends of the bases, a partition plate is arranged in the integrated hydrogen production gasification furnace, and the partition plate is fixedly connected to the lower ends of the bases. A gasification chamber and a combustion chamber are sequentially arranged in the integrated hydrogen production gasifier from left to right, the gasification chamber is arranged on the left side of the partition plate, and the combustion chamber is arranged on the right side of the partition plate. According to the integrated hydrogen production gasification furnace, the discharging opening is formed in the partition plate of the integrated hydrogen production gasification furnace and is matched with the two elastic sliding lifting plates, so that the sealing performance of carbon residues generated after pyrolysis gasification reaction in the gasification chamber rightwards enters the combustion chamber of the integrated hydrogen production gasification furnace is guaranteed, the purity of collected combustible gas is guaranteed, and the integrated hydrogen production gasification furnace is integrated equipment; the device has the advantages of small occupied area and low cost."
