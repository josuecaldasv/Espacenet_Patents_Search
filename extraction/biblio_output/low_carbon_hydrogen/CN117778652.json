According to the process, after furnace top gas is subjected to dust removal, dehydration and carbon dioxide removal, one part of gas and one part of hydrogen are mixed and heated and then are introduced from an air opening in the upper portion of a melting furnace, sufficient reduction potential and heat are provided for reduction of iron oxide on the upper portion of the reduction melting furnace, and the metallization ratio of the upper portion of the reduction melting furnace reaches 90% or above; and the other part of gas is introduced from the lower part of the reduction melting furnace to provide heat for the lower part of the reduction melting furnace and adjust the air volume of the lower part. Through cooperation of the upper gas and the lower gas, gas distribution of the upper portion and the lower portion of the total-oxygen hydrogen-rich low-carbon reduction melting furnace is optimized, and the purpose that the metallization ratio at different heights of a blocky belt in the furnace is uniform in the radial direction is achieved; and zero emission of the top gas can be realized by circulating the top gas at the lower part. According to the process, the coke ratio can be greatly reduced, and the carbon emission is reduced."
