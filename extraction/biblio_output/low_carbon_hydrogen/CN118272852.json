The preparation method comprises the following steps: firstly, carrying out ultrasonic treatment on a mixed solution containing 0.1-1g of the carbon carrier, 2-5000mg of heteropoly acid serving as a platinum complex ligand, 0.05-5mg of chloroplatinic acid and 2-25ml of an organic solvent at room temperature for 0.5-4h, then completely drying the mixture at 50-90 DEG C, and then calcining the mixture at 300-600 DEG C in a hydrogen atmosphere for 2-4h to obtain the carbon-loaded Pt catalyst, wherein the mixed solution contains 0.1-1g of the carbon carrier, 2-5000mg of heteropoly acid serving as a platinum complex ligand, 0.05-5mg of chloroplatinic acid and 2-25ml of an organic solvent. The preparation method is simple, the prepared platinum-carbon catalyst is low in Pt content and good in catalytic performance, and the quality activity of the platinum-carbon catalyst can reach up to 32.8 A/mg Pt and is 2-3 times of the activity of the currently reported optimal platinum catalyst."
