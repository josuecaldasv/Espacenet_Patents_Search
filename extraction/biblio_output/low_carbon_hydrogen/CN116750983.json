Mixing the secondary aluminum ash with quick lime, taking aluminum oxide in the secondary aluminum ash as an aluminum source, and taking the quick lime as a calcium source; after the mixture is ignited by the ignition substance, the oxidation reaction of aluminum nitride, aluminum carbide and metal aluminum in the secondary aluminum ash is used as a heat source, villiaumite and chlorine salt in the secondary aluminum ash are used as pro-oxidants, and calcium aluminate is synthesized through self-heating calcination in an oxidizing atmosphere, so that low-carbon preparation of the aluminate cement from the secondary aluminum ash is realized. The aluminate cement is prepared from the secondary aluminum ash, and the aluminum resource characteristics of the secondary aluminum ash are fully utilized; aluminum nitride, aluminum carbide and metal aluminum in the secondary aluminum ash are oxidized by oxygen, so that hazardous gases such as ammonia gas, methane and hydrogen are prevented from being generated by hydrolysis of the aluminum nitride, the aluminum carbide and the metal aluminum; the oxidation reaction of aluminum nitride, aluminum carbide and metal aluminum is used as a heat source, villiaumite and chlorine salt are used as pro-oxidants, and an external heat source is not needed in the calcining process. The method has the advantages of being short in process, low in carbon and easy to industrialize."
