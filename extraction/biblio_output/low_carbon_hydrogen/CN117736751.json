According to the method, CO2 is used as heat carrying and reaction gas, high-temperature sensible heat of red coke is absorbed in a pre-storage section, coke is cooled, and meanwhile, a large amount of heat energy is absorbed in the process of preparing CO through reaction of CO2 and coke; carrying out coke quenching in a coke quenching section by adopting N2; heat of CO, CO2 and N2 is recovered through a waste heat boiler, cooled N2 is recycled, after CO and CO2 are cleaned and separated through low-temperature methanol, CO serves as synthesis gas to be used for synthesizing chemicals, CO2 continues to be used for pre-quenching coke, and coupling of dry quenching and synthesis gas preparation is achieved. According to the method disclosed by the invention, the high-temperature sensible heat utilization rate of the red coke can be improved, the reduction of the coke yield caused by carbon melting loss in a high-temperature section is reduced, meanwhile, the synthesis gas CO generated in the coke quenching process can be used for producing chemical products (such as methanol, ethylene and the like) together with coke oven hydrogen, and the recycling of CO2 in a park is realized."
