The preparation method comprises the following steps: carrying out thermal copolymerization on melamine and malonamide to obtain modified carbon nitride, mixing the modified carbon nitride with a purchased Ti3C2 reagent, carrying out ultrasonic treatment to obtain black powder, and carrying out photoreduction on chloroauric acid to obtain the ternary composite photocatalyst. The hydrogen production rates of the photocatalyst under simulated sunlight and visible light are respectively 778.7 mu mol/h/g and 122.1 mu mol/h/g, which are increased by 99.8 times and infinity times compared with those of unmodified carbon nitride. And particularly, the service life of the cable can reach 120 hours. The ternary composite photocatalyst is designed and prepared on the basis of the synergistic effect of the composite material, the method is simple and easy to implement, the synthesis condition is mild, the main components are low in price, industrial production is easy, and high hydrogen production performance and long-time light stability are both considered, so that the ternary composite photocatalyst has good application prospects."
