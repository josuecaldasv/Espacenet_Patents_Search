And wide-load soft combustion of hydrogen fuel is realized. Hydrogen is a carbon-free energy carrier and is an important fuel for realizing decarburization and emission reduction in the gas turbine industry, however, the hydrogen has the characteristics of high adiabatic flame temperature, dominant diffusion and the like, so that the problems of high NOx emission, easy thermo-acoustic oscillation, easy tempering and the like are generated when the hydrogen is used as the fuel of the gas turbine. Low NOx emission of hydrogen fuel can be achieved through soft combustion, the problems of thermo-acoustic oscillation, tempering and the like are solved, but the performance is seriously deteriorated under the variable load condition, and the requirement of a wide-load gas turbine cannot be met. The variable working condition performance of soft combustion is improved through catalytic combustion, high-efficiency and low-NOx emission combustion of hydrogen fuel under the wide load condition is achieved, and the problems that in hydrogen combustion, NOx emission is high, thermo-acoustic oscillation is likely to happen, and tempering is likely to happen are effectively solved."
