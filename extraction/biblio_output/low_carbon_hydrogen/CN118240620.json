Essential oil in plant tissues in feed liquid is extracted through the heating device, the ultrasonic device and the microwave generating device in the distillation tank, and essential oil and hydrolat are separated through the condensing device and the oil-water separating device. The plant essential oil distillation type extraction device solves the problems that an existing plant essential oil distillation type extraction device cannot perform continuous extraction in the using process and is low in essential oil extraction rate, is suitable for continuous extraction of essential oil in granular and powdery plant materials, has the advantages of continuity and water saving, and can remarkably improve the extraction efficiency of the plant essential oil."
