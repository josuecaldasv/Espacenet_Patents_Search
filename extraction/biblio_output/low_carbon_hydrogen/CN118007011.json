The process comprises the working procedures of green pellet pretreatment, green pellet cooling, finished pellet continuous conveying, finished pellet reduction and electric arc furnace smelting. Zero carbon emission is divided into three stages, in the first stage, green electricity is used for heating air to serve as energy input in oxidizing roasting of pellets, and zero carbon emission in pellet production is achieved; in the second stage, the pellets are reduced, hydrogen is used as a reducing agent, and the hydrogen is green hydrogen; and in the third stage, smelting of the direct reduction iron is smelting of an electric arc furnace, and the used energy is green electricity. No CO2 is generated in the whole technological process from roasting of the raw material pellets to production of the final qualified molten steel, the purpose that carbon is replaced with hydrogen is achieved, and the industrial application prospect is wide. According to the method, the direct reduced iron and the qualified molten steel can be efficiently prepared at low cost, energy is saved, consumption is reduced, and industrial large-scale production, popularization and application are facilitated."
