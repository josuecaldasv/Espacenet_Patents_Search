According to the method, an electric-biological enhancement technology and a sulfate reduction effect are combined, immobilization of the heavy metal in the low-permeability water-containing medium is enhanced, sulfate is firstly added into a water-containing layer, the heavy metal is immobilized through a sulfate reduction product to be detoxified, and then a dechlorinating microbial agent is added into the water-containing layer to degrade chlorinated hydrocarbon, so that the heavy metal in the low-permeability water-containing medium is degraded. And in-situ remediation of combined pollution is realized. Moreover, the added sulfate can be fixed by iron minerals in the aquifer after being reduced into sulfide through indigenous sulfate reducing bacteria, and secondary pollution caused by hydrogen sulfide is avoided; the introduced carbon source and dechlorination microbial inoculum have no side effect on microbial communities in the underground environment. According to the method, the adsorption capacity of the heavy metal in the low-permeability aquifer can be remarkably improved, meanwhile, the continuous treatment capacity on chlorinated hydrocarbon-heavy metal pollutants invaded for the second time is achieved, and environmental friendliness is achieved."
