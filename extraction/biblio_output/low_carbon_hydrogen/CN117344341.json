According to the preparation method, the self-supporting electro-catalysis electrode with the zinc-sulfur compound and the nitrogen-doped carbon composite material deposited on the surface by taking the carbon cloth as the substrate is prepared through electro-deposition by using the cyclic voltammetry, and the electro-deposition method can control the deposition process by simply controlling the external potential, so that a nano material is easy to prepare; the equipment is simple and convenient, easy to operate, high in deposition speed and short in sample preparation time. Compared with a common electro-catalysis electrode, the content of platinum and transition metal sulfide is rich, the preparation cost is relatively low, and meanwhile, relatively high conductivity and excellent electrochemical performance are achieved; the defect carbon-based material prepared by doping heteroatoms has excellent electro-catalytic performance, and the zinc-sulfur compound and the nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterial are loaded on the carbon cloth, so that the electrochemical activity and the conductivity of the zinc-sulfur compound and the nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterial are further improved."
