According to the present invention, the gold-silver nano-enzyme is a gold-silver nano-enzyme, 2, 2 ', 5, 5'-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) is blue oxTMB with surface enhanced Raman spectrum activity, the addition of arsenic inhibits the peroxidase activity of the gold-silver nano-enzyme, when the As3 < + > or As5 < + > exists, the As3 < + > or As5 < + > can competitively chelate the sulfydryl in the DTT so as to cause the reassembly of the Au and AgNPs nano-enzyme, and the reassembled nano-enzyme has low peroxidase-like activity so as to significantly inhibit the TMB reaction; based on the principle, high-sensitivity detection of As is realized, and the linear detection limit reaches 0.5 mu g/L. The established method is applied to determination of arsenic in a food sample, has a good standard addition recovery rate, and has the characteristics of simplicity in operation, high sensitivity, rapidness and the like."
