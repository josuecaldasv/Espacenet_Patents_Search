The present invention is a polymerizable composition comprising (A) a cyclized polymerizable carboxylic acid having a partial structure represented by formula (1) and/or a salt thereof, (B) a [beta]-oxycarboxylic acid having a partial structure represented by any one of formulae (2) to (4) (wherein R and R' each independently represent a hydrogen atom or a saturated hydrocarbon group having 4 or less carbon atoms) and/or a salt thereof; and (C) a radically polymerizable compound that is different from the cyclized polymerizable carboxylic acid and/or the salt thereof (A) or the [beta]-oxycarboxylic acid and/or the salt thereof (B), in which the molar ratio of a partial structure contained in the polymerizable composition in a largest molar amount in the polymerizable composition, among the partial structures respectively represented by formulae (2) to (4), is 1.5 or less relative to the molar amount, i.e., 100, of the partial structure represented by formula (1)."
