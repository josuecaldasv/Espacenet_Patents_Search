A phosphorus-containing polycyclic aromatic hydroxy compound represented by the general formula (1). In the general formula (1), m is an integer of 1 to 20, n1 is each independently an integer of 1 to 4, and Ar is an aromatic ring (excluding a benzene ring) having 6 to 30 carbon atoms which may each independently have a substituent. R1 is each independently hydrogen, a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or a substituent represented by the general formula (2), and at least one R1 contains the structure of general formula (2). X represents a linking group and is each independently oxygen, sulfur, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkylene having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or substituted or unsubstituted aralkylene having 8 to 20 carbon atoms."
