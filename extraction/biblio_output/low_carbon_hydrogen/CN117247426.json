According to the invention, the gas in the hydrogenation kettle is replaced by nitrogen, and then the nitrogen is replaced by hydrogen and is kept consistent with the external air pressure, so that the reaction is carried out in a normal-pressure hydrogen environment, the safety risk is low, the hydrogen is in full contact with a reaction system, the pressure in the reaction process is constant, the flow rate of the hydrogen does not need to be adjusted, and the risk of misoperation is reduced."
