An organic carbon source is introduced and doped into hydrotalcite to form defect sites so as to increase the specific surface area of the catalyst. The prepared catalyst forms a nickel particle cluster with a special carbon-nickel structure as a main component while retaining the original hydrotalcite structure, enhances the mutual action, inhibits aggregation and leaching of nickel, and is beneficial to promoting adsorption and activation of the catalyst to feed gas, so that the activity and hydrogen production of the catalyst are improved, and the hydrogen production rate of the catalyst is increased. According to the invention, the dispersity of the catalytic active metal is increased, the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst is improved, the single hydrogen production amount in a water phase reforming experiment is higher than 270 mmol/g, the hydrogen production amount is obviously increased at low cost, and the hydrogen production amount can still reach 70% or more of the maximum value after circular reaction for 100 hours or more. According to the invention, the defects that the existing nickel-magnesium-aluminum hydrotalcite catalyst is easy to sinter and the structure is easy to collapse to cause inactivation and the like are overcome."
