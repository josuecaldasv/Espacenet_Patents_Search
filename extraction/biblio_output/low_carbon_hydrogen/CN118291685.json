The device is used for mixed gas obtained by heating decarburized gas of a hydrogen-rich carbon circulating oxygen blast furnace, so that the hydrogen-rich gas can be sprayed into the furnace to participate in reduction at a higher temperature without passing through a gas heating furnace, and meanwhile, the defect that hydrogen-rich gas H2 in coke oven gas reacts with SiO2 in refractory materials after passing through the gas heating furnace to degrade the performance of the refractory materials is avoided."
