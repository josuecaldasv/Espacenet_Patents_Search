The reactor comprises a combustion zone, a mixing pre-reaction zone located at the downstream of the combustion zone, a main reaction zone located at the downstream of the mixing pre-reaction zone and a quenching zone located at the downstream of the main reaction zone. The method is implemented on the basis of the reactor and comprises the following steps that S1, hydrogen and a mixture of water vapor and oxygen are introduced into the hydrogen-oxygen combustor at the same time, and high-temperature water vapor generated by hydrogen combustion enters the combustion area barrel; s2, high-temperature water vapor sequentially flows through the shrinkage cone-shaped body and the equal-diameter short section and is mixed with raw materials from the first raw material inlet and the second raw material inlet, part of the raw materials are cracked, then the materials enter the expansion cone-shaped body and are mixed and reacted with raw materials from the third raw material inlet, a reaction product enters a quenching area to be cooled, and a target product is obtained. Compared with the prior art, the reactor and the method have the characteristics of wide raw material application range, high target product selectivity and the like."
