                "p": "In two-stage cracking processes in which in the first stage the oil with products obtained <PICT:0466682/III/1> from the process is cracked in the liquid phase under mild \"viscosity breaking\" conditions and the cracked products separated into liquid and vapours which latter in the second stage are cracked in the vapour phase, the liquid residues of low carbon/hydrogen ratio from the second cracking stage are rejected but the residue from the first stage is flashed and the vapours obtained are condensed and used as recycle stock for the first stage. Crude oil is passed through a line 1 into a fractionator 3, from the bottom of which reflux is drawn off and passed through coils 5<1>, 7 comprising the first cracking zone into an evaporator 11. Vapours from the vessel 11 are passed at about 1000 DEG F. through the coils 13<1>, 14, 8 comprising the vapour phase cracking zone and thence through a line 15 to a conversion arrester 17 fed with condensate supplied through a line 18 from the tower 3 and cooled in a heat exchanger 18<1>. The products from the arrester 17 are flashed in a tower 25 and the vapours evolved are passed through a line 26 into the tower 3 while the residues are removed through a cooler 27<1> to storage. The primary residues pass from the evaporator 11 through a line 29 to a still 31 heated by a steam coil 31<1> or maintained under vacuum by a steam jet 32<1>. The vapours evolved pass through a line 33 to a condenser 34 and the condensate is collected in an accumulator 35 from which it is pumped through a line 40 to the column 3. In a modification, the distillation of the primary residues is effected under a vacuum obtained by connecting the pipe 33 through a Venturi nozzle to the pipe 26. The vapours passing off from the top of the tower 3 are condensed and freed from gases which are compressed, and the condensates obtained are stabilized in a tower 67 provided with a reboiler 69 to which heat is supplied by circulating therethrough a hot fraction cycled from the tower 3 through lines 67<1>, 68. Specification 412,461 is referred to."
