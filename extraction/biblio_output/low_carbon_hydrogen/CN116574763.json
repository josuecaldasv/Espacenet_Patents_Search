The preparation method comprises the following steps: S1, inoculating an LB liquid culture medium with phosphorus-accumulating bacteria with a phosphorus removal effect of 10-20 mg/L, and culturing for 10-12 hours in a shaking table under the conditions that the temperature is 25 DEG C and the speed is 120 r/min; s2, adding lithium hydrogen phosphate into the culture solution, and continuously culturing for 22-26 hours; s3, adding ferrous sulfate into the culture solution, and continuously culturing for 24-36 hours; s4, adding lithium chloride into the culture solution, and continuously culturing for 22-26 hours; and S5, centrifuging to remove the culture solution, drying the sample, and annealing at 750-850 DEG C for 3-5 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere. A lithium iron phosphate material synthesized by phosphorus-accumulating bacteria and activated carbon are prepared into double electrodes, and lithium chloride in a water body is recovered based on a Faraday capacitor and a double-electrode-layer capacitor by utilizing a hybrid capacitive deionization technology, so that high-efficiency, high-adsorption-capacity, low-cost, low-energy-consumption and pollution-free recovery of lithium can be realized, and the lithium can be recycled."
