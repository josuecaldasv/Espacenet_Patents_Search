The pressure container comprises a lining, a valve seat and a shell. The lining is of a cavity structure with the two ends open and is used for containing hydrogen. The two valve seats are installed in the openings in the two ends of the lining respectively, the two valve seats and the lining are integrally formed, and the valve seats are used for being connected with an external inflation connector. The shell covers the outer surface of the lining and comprises an inner layer and an outer layer; the inner layer is formed by paving unidirectional carbon fiber prepreg layer by layer, and the inner layer wraps the outer surface of the lining; the outer layer is formed by paving glass cloth prepreg layer by layer, and the outer layer wraps the outer surface of the inner layer. According to the manufacturing method of the pressure vessel, a winding process is replaced by a paving process, vacuumizing is carried out in the paving process and during curing, and curing forming is carried out under the low-temperature and high-pressure conditions of the autoclave, so that the problems of high manufacturing difficulty, long production period and low production cost caused by the winding process adopted in the conventional pressure vessel manufacturing are solved. The porosity of the carbon fiber composite material is high, and the compactness is insufficient."
