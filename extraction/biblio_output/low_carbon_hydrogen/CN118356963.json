The catalyst is a nitrogen-doped activated carbon supported PtBi bimetallic catalyst composed of an active component Pt, an auxiliary agent Bi and a carrier nitrogen-doped activated carbon. The invention also discloses a preparation method and application of the compound. After the nitrogen-doped activated carbon supported PtBi bimetallic catalyst disclosed by the invention is reduced by hydrogen, in a trickle bed gas-solid-liquid three-phase benzyl alcohol reaction process, efficient, continuous and stable conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde is realized under solvent-free and alkali-free mild reaction conditions (low temperature and low pressure), and the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol can be gt; the selectivity of benzaldehyde can be gt; and moreover, the catalyst is not inactivated after continuous operation for 100 hours, and the catalyst shows excellent activity, selectivity and stability. The method solves the problems of separation, corrosion and solid waste caused by the adoption of a large amount of solvent and alkali in the traditional process and the problem of catalyst deactivation caused by intermittent kettle type operation."
