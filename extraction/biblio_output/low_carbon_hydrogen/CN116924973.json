According to the invention, benzylidene glycine methyl ester is firstly subjected to hydrogen extraction to form carbon anions, and then the carbon anions and 3-chloro-2-fluoro-5-trifluoromethylpyridine are subjected to substitution reaction to construct a main carbon skeleton of the product, so that the reaction selectivity is higher, the reaction yield is high, and the reaction conditions are mild, therefore, the preparation method disclosed by the invention is novel, good in selectivity and suitable for industrial production. The total preparation cost is low, and the yield is high."
