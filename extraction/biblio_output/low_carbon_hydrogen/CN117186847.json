The organopolysiloxane comprises organopolysiloxane containing a vinyl group and organopolysiloxane containing a hydrogen group; the acrylic ester comprises butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate; according to the heat-conducting gel, the diatomite and the white carbon black with adsorbability are added, so that the oil yield of the heat-conducting gel can be remarkably reduced, meanwhile, the acrylic ester is added to coat the outer surface of the inorganic heat-conducting filler, the purpose of enhancing the strength and the toughness of the heat-conducting gel is achieved, and the heat-conducting gel forms a steady-state heat-conducting fluid through the organopolysiloxane, so that the heat-conducting gel has a good heat-conducting effect. The coating has the advantages of high thermal conductivity, low permeability, good heat resistance, low viscosity, stable performance, long-term storage and the like."
