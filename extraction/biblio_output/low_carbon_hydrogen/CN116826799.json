The ship hydrogen circulation system can effectively utilize seawater wind energy or redundant energy of a ship main power grid, on the basis that the energy consumption of the circulation system is as little as possible, operation of the circulation system is guaranteed and maintained, hydrogen is stably generated, and when a ship breaks down seriously to cause power loss or the capacity of a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank is about to be full, the circulation system is started. According to the system, the problems that the wind power generation output voltage is unstable and the electric energy storage capacity is insufficient are effectively solved, the selected fuel energy storage density is large, the hydrogen power generation device is free of pollution during combustion, and low-carbon green operation of the ship is powerfully promoted."
