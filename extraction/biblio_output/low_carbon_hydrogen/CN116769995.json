According to the method, a fluidized bed reaction device and a smelting reduction reactor are combined, iron ore powder enters a circulating fluidized bed after being preheated, pure hydrogen is adopted for prereduction at the low temperature of about 700 DEG C, and meanwhile the fluidized bed device is used for further heating; the method comprises the following steps: injecting preheated and pre-reduced iron ore and a flux into liquid metal in an iron bath furnace, injecting hydrogen-rich gas into the liquid metal at the same time to finish reduction of iron oxide, inserting an injection pipe into the upper part of the iron bath furnace, injecting oxygen-rich gas into the furnace to carry out hydrogen combustion, and providing heat required by reaction in the furnace, and produced liquid metal is discharged and then subjected to subsequent development treatment. According to the invention, cyclic utilization of the energy medium is realized, the whole production process is green and environment-friendly, and no CO2 is generated. According to the process thought, carbon is replaced by hydrogen, the industrial application prospect is wide, and high practical significance and social benefits are achieved."
