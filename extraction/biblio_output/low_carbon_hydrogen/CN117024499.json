Therefore, the subsequent product yield is low, and the cost is relatively high. According to the preparation method disclosed by the invention, the steroid compound reacts with the aprotic solvent by utilizing the catalyst with high activity and strong alkalinity, so that carbon anions are formed at the site 2 of the steroid compound, and then the steroid compound and the ester compound which does not contain a hydrogen and has relatively strong activity are condensed to obtain 17beta-hydroxyandrostane-4-ene-2-hydroxymethylene-3-ketone, so that the generation of byproducts is reduced, and the yield of 17beta-hydroxyandrostane-4-ene-2-hydroxymethylene-3-ketone is improved.
