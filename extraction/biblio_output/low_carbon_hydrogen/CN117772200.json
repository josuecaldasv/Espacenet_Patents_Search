According to the method, a precursor obtained by exchanging part of Mg ions in hydroxide gel through Ni ions is obtained through ion exchange, the nickel-based CO2 methanation catalyst with an overall wrapping structure is formed by wrapping Ni metal nanoparticles with a magnesium oxide carrier after calcination, and the wrapping degree of the nickel-based CO2 methanation catalyst is affected by calcination in other different atmospheres before hydrogen section calcination. When the catalytic temperature is 300-500 DEG C, the catalytic activity close to the catalytic activity obtained by completely using hydrogen for calcination is achieved, and the use of hydrogen is reduced; the obtained catalyst is good in low-temperature catalytic performance, and also has the advantages of oxidation resistance and coking resistance; moreover, the preparation method of the catalyst is simple and is very suitable for large-scale production."
